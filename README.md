# SoCPlanner
SoCPlanner is a module planning web application for NUS School of Computing students jointly developed by me and @zhuoyang125 for NUS Orbital 2021, and we achieved the Apollo Advanced Award. The frontend uses ReactJS, while the backend uses NodeJS and all data is stored on a MongoDB database.

This application allows you to:
1. Plan out the modules you intend to take for your 4 years in NUS!
2. Check if you pass the graduating requirements for your chosen major and specialisation
3. Import module plans from our database for your desired major or specialisation
4. Save your module plan as a JPEG

No account is needed to use the application, as your module plan will be automatically saved in your browser's local storage. üëç

However, creating an account will provide you with these additional features:
1. Submitting your module plan to help future batches of NUS SOC students
2. Commenting on submitted module plans
3. Rating submitted module plans

(The application might take a few minutes to startup due to Heroku's policy.)
